  summary:
    "In the SVA pre-college program the first project I had to do was  “The Big Head Project”. For this project I had to design a big head that you could put on/over your head. I decided to do Darwin from “The Amazing World of Gumball”  because that was one of my favorite childhood shows and I thought it would be funny to make a giant fish head. To make Darwin I used cardboard, hot glue guns, duct tape, newspaper, mod podge, orange paint, back paint, paintbrushes, sponge brush, and a heat gun.",
  content: `I made this giant orange head for my first SVA pre-college program which is called “The Big head Project”. This project is exactly like the name, you have to make a big head that you can put over your head. To make this head I had to first sketch the top angle, front angle, and side angles. To make the base structure of the head a lot of cardboard. For the upper half of Darwin’s head I made a circular shape and to make the head curve scored the cardboard, so that I could fold it inwards. For the lower half I did the same thing I did for the upper half.

  I made an oval shape out of the cardboard, scored the top of the cardboard to make it curved at the top, and for the chin I made a kind of U shape and scored the top to make it kind of slanted. For the fin I just cut out a thin piece of cardboard and hot glued it on.  After making the base, I hot glued and tape a ton of newspaper to the base to make the face plump and chubby. Then, I put tape all over the face to keep the newspaper from falling out and to make the face somewhat smooth. I took more newspaper, mod podge it onto the face, and waited for it to dry. Once it was dried I finally painted the whole head orange and used black paint for the face and fin.

  Although my friends, a pre-college professor, and I found my sculpture really funny, I was not really happy with it because I spent a lot of time on this project and it is so uncreative and unoriginal. If I had to make another big head I would do something that I came up with using my imagination and not be scared of trying to make something hard.
