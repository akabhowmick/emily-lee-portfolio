  summary:
    "I initially aimed to create a head inspired by Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, but as it progressed, I wasn't satisfied and shifted my focus to crafting a scary clown. I envisioned a round clown nose, a jester hat, and to enhance its oddities, I added round balls as hair. To further achieve an unsettling effect, I intentionally left the skin rough and textured, avoiding any smoothing to amplify the eerie appearance.",
  content: `The second project I did for the SVA pre-college program was making a plaster head out of someone you know. My friend and I decided to do each other, but we made each other look funny. My friend made me look like Link from the legend of Zelda and I was originally going to make her into a funny clown, but decided to make it look scary. 
  //break
  For this project:
  //break 1. You had to make your head idea out of clay
  //break 2. Second you would put plastic rectangles into the middle of the head and then put thick layers of plaster onto the clay head,
  //break 3. Third you would carefully chisel the plaster mode along the cracks and the plaster would open in half to reveal the clay head that was inside,
  //break 4. Fourth you would take all the clay out of the head mold and then plaster the plaster head mold closed.
  //break 5. Fifth you would fill the two sides of the plaster head mold 
  //break 6. In my opinion I had the most fun doing this project because I like working with clay. Clay is very fun to use in my opinion and I was allowed to make weird textures on the clay and I just had a blast.
