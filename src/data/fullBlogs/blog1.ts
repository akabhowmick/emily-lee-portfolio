    "Hi! My name is Angela Tan , but you can call me Angela . I'm currently a 9th grader with a passion for medicine. Ever since I was young, I have been fascinated by how medical professionals make such a meaningful impact on peopleâ€™s lives. I am excited to dive deeper into biology and start my journey towards becoming a doctor. Through this account, I will be sharing my experiences in high school and exploring the world of medicine. I hope to inspire and connect with others who share similar goals. Thanks for following along!",
