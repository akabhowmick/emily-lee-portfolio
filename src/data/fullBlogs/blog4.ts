  title: "Exploring New Passions Through School Clubs",
  summary:
    "Joining clubs at my high school has allowed me to discover new interests and connect with others through debate, volunteer work, and community engagement.",
  content: `Joining clubs at my school has been one of the most exciting parts of my high school experience. With so many different clubs and activities to choose from, I was eager to explore all the options at our student activities fair. Walking around from table to table, I was amazed by the variety of clubs that were offered, from academic groups to gaming groups. I made it a point to visit every table and explore the value of those clubs. This exploration has allowed me to discover new interests and meet incredible people while narrowing it down to four of my favorite clubs, one debate club and three volunteering clubs. Even though there were other clubs that caught my interest, I decided to just stick to a few this year on the more academic route.

    From my very first debate meeting, I knew I had found the perfect fit for me. As the coaches introduced debate, I realized that this club offered way more opportunities than just public forum debate; it opened up a wider range of debate opportunities, including student congress, speech, and more. But it was public forum, my favorite, that drew me in the most. I believed that I could strengthen this team and my abilities by bringing in my knowledge of debate from the past years while continuing to practice and learn new things while preparing. The excitement of crafting arguments, debating real-world issues, and working with my partner takes my attention every time. However, the variety offered by this club sparked something deeper in me. I became eager to challenge myself by exploring other forms of debate as it may grow closer to me. As I remembered, debate was something that I strongly hated at first but grew to like over time. I feel that if I give new things a try I will find my passion in it.

    I knew that I wanted to contribute to my school community by helping out and supporting the local community around me. My school offered two clubs that did volunteer work. I have joined both, but since it's just the beginning, I have not yet gotten a feel of which one will be the right one for me. I knew that the more I experienced these clubs, one would spark my interest. The Key Club and The Hero Club will give me the chance to engage in community service on a global level. Knowing that my efforts, whether big or small, contribute to a worldwide mission of helping others really motivates me. If that happens, this club will empower me to contribute to the local community around me. From supporting children’s hospitals to raising awareness for environmental issues, I’ve realized that my efforts can extend far beyond the walls of my school. Being part of a worldwide organization with the same goal of helping others makes every project feel purposeful. I love to see and make change to our society.

    In the future, I would like to keep pursuing debate at school, art, volunteering, and maybe even joining sports teams like cheerleading. These different activities make up who I am.`,
